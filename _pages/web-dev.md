Code at <https://github.com/ashlynnpai/dungeon>

This was the final React.js project in the Data Visualization certificate for FreeCodeCamp. The requirements were to create a map and fill it with items and enemies that can be engaged. Only the area immediately surrounding the character would be visible and the rest of the map would be hidden. The character increases in level by fighting enemies and the game ends by defeating a final boss enemy.

#### Netflix Clone

Code at <https://github.com/ashlynnpai/myflix>

This was the main Rails project at Tealeaf Academy. The focus was on test driven development and integration with third-party services. One of the highlights was setting up a well-tested subscription service using Stripe for payment processing. Here are some blog posts I wrote in 2015 talking about integrating Stripe into a Rails application:

Web-based code at <https://github.com/ashlynnpai/blackjack-web/>

Text-based code at <https://github.com/ashlynnpai/blackjack/>

These were projects for the Ruby portion of Tealeaf Academy. The web-based blackjack uses Sinatra framework to render views to the browser. The text-based version is an exercise in object-oriented programming.

This is a list of courses where I completed enough requirements to get a passing grade as defined by the instructor of the course (usually 60-80%), whether or not I got a certificate. In some courses a certificate was not offered, but in most cases I didn't pay for a certificate due to the large number of courses I take. Free certificates were phased out by Coursera and edx in 2016.
