This was the final React.js project in the Data Visualization certificate for FreeCodeCamp. The requirements were to create a map and fill it with items and enemies that can be engaged. Only the area immediately surrounding the character would be visible and the rest of the map would be hidden. The character would increase in level by fighting enemies and the game ends by defeating a final boss enemy.

This is a list of courses where I completed enough requirements to get a passing grade as defined by the instructor of the course (usually 60-80%), whether or not I got a certificate. In some courses a certificate was not offered, but in most cases I didn't pay for a certificate due to the large number of courses I take. Free certificates were phased out by Coursera and edx in 2016.
