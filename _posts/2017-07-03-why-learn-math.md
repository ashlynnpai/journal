I've been spending the past few months trying to improve my math skills, sadly at the expense of my other recent goal, learning Java. One of my major motivators is wanting to do the AI courses at Udacity, which sound insanely interesting, or just learn more about AI in general. I think about this goal a lot when studying math. 

I also feel that my problem-solving skills have improved and I'm developing patience, as I sometimes have to redo a problem several times trying to find the error(s). I enjoy debugging and hunting down a logical mistake or syntax error but redoing math problems, not so much, although as with anything else, you get used to it over time.
