I've been learning online since 2014, and it's my favorite method of learning. I love the flexibility and the unending catalogs. My focus is computer science and programming, but I've taken some courses because I had a personal interest in the subject matter or just because the course sounded interesting. Overall, I'm interested in the problems that can be solved with code. These days I'm mostly at edx and Coursera, although I do use other sites. Here is a partial list of <a class="page-link" href="/_pages/courses/">courses</a> I've completed.

On the web dev front I've done a couple of online coding bootcamps, and I plan to use freeCodeCamp to work on my Javascript skills. When I was first starting out, Treehouse helped me to get my projects up and running.

I've found that the most meaningful courses were the ones where I completed projects, though they can be very time-consuming. It might be a choice between taking one course that has a large project or several that don't. 

I've also found that if I don't use or at least refresh what I learned, it will fall out of my head, but I should be able to relearn it much faster when I focus on that skill again.
